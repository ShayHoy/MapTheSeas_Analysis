1,Nov 08 2017 06:55 PM,Would need new depth sounder that transfers data easier. ,
2,Nov 05 2017 09:10 AM,"My boating is in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, not any bay or ocean areas so I don't know if my data would apply to your study. ",
3,Nov 02 2017 11:26 AM,"I do not go boating as often as I would like. I am not sure I could provide much input, but would still like to participate if possible.",
4,Nov 02 2017 12:14 AM,"I have several.    I would need details of what is collected, what is uploaded and how that data and my contact information would be used.    I would also like to know what kind of vetting process goes into the collected data.",
5,Nov 01 2017 06:24 PM,Iâ€™m fine with being a part of a collective effort to improve and enhance maritime safety ,
6,Nov 01 2017 05:56 PM,Data would have to be anonymized upon request.  No selling of data to partners or third parties.  No PII.,
7,Nov 01 2017 09:13 AM,"I would expect that crowd sourced data would not be used in a proprietary way- that it would be open to public use. Locking mariners out with a pay wall would not work for me.
FYI: I cruise from Md to down east Me, (passing by NJ as quickly as possible) but sail my native NH coast as much as possible.",
8,Nov 01 2017 09:01 AM,I am a bit concerned sbout privacy.  I would need to know that my PII was protected.,
9,Nov 01 2017 05:10 AM,This concept is already available they Activecaptain.com and Navtronics charts.,
10,Jun 23 2017 09:36 AM,Data must not be sold for profit like Active Captain just did,
11,Jun 06 2017 02:46 PM,Data likely not accurate unless everyone has GPS antennas directly over their transducers.,
12,Jun 02 2017 01:08 PM,Nope,
13,Jun 01 2017 02:32 PM,"I have no hardware that can record depth data, and the cost to obtain hardware that can do this is high. Low end fishfinders are cheap, so an incentive to upgrade would mean I am more willing to participate. Also, please collect data from more than just US waters, as everyone worldwide can benefit from improved data.",
14,Jun 01 2017 09:44 AM,"If you research Navionics charting and the Active Captain community, you'll find that what you're proposing is actually already being done. Navionics now collects depth information directly from vessels running the appropriate hardware, and Active Captain is a world-wide crowd-source community of boaters who make hundreds of observations each day in the Active Captain (now owned by Garmin) database.",
15,May 18 2017 04:21 PM,Accuracy of depth sounders on different boats maybe without aligned offset ,
16,May 16 2017 12:23 AM,Work with the Sea Scouts and promote the STEM learning opportunity for youth members.,
17,May 15 2017 07:29 PM,Cell/mobile data does not work offshore.,
18,May 15 2017 07:28 PM,No,
19,May 15 2017 05:04 PM,None,
20,May 15 2017 07:27 AM,This should also be focused on common commercial fishing areas with poor to non existent sea-floor data,
21,May 07 2017 02:21 PM,Availability and usability of new data,
22,Apr 14 2017 05:37 PM,No.,
23,Apr 14 2017 03:58 PM,"Not at all, for the safety of our sailors, a croud scan of my lake would be really a technological breakthrough as the current data is proprietary and restricted. No detailed maps exist, current is based on fisherman's anecdotes and groundings... please contact me if interested: yorick.klipfel@sunrise.ch or www.acvl.ch",
24,Apr 13 2017 01:00 PM,Not real concerns,
25,Apr 13 2017 12:21 PM,Why is this necessary?  Navionics has been doing this for several years. The information is very accurate and updated weekly. All at a minimal cost ,
26,Apr 12 2017 10:56 PM,Involuntary tracking of the vessels location,
27,Apr 12 2017 10:35 PM,No,
28,Apr 12 2017 09:09 PM,Privacy,
29,Apr 12 2017 05:11 PM,Spend Six months of year in Mexican waters.,
30,Apr 12 2017 03:57 PM,"Sometimes question the accuracy of crowd sourced data . For example, Active Captain is not always accurate.  Would want multiple verifications to insure accuracy.",
31,Apr 12 2017 01:57 PM,"About the best you're going to get aboard most recreational cruising sailboats, in terms of installed equipment for reading the seafloor, is a depthsounder.",
32,Mar 29 2017 03:18 PM,"The Cooperative Charting Program operated by NOAA in partnership with the U.S. Power Squadron, and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary is already in place. Rather 
than start yet another program with all its associated problems of organization and maintenance, I recommend you tap into these programs and use their existing proven networks to accomplish your goal. And don't forget the NOAA requirement to validate/qualify third-party data before use in nautical charting. Not a trivial consideration. Best to talk to these folks early on to benefit from their years of experience doing what you are describing.  Rather than re-invent the wheel improve it. Best of luck with your project!

NOAA Cartographer (retired)",
33,Mar 22 2017 03:14 PM,Would want to make sure that there was some outside verification that data was more accurate than not.,
34,Mar 07 2017 04:30 PM,Ability to turn app off for breaking the law is necessary. ,
35,Mar 06 2017 04:15 PM,"Will the data be used to assemble nautical charts? Since charts are legal documents, and the data and data collection procedures that are used to compile charts may be examined in court (e.g. in events such as vessel groundings), would the participants be held legally responsible for the data they collect? ",
36,Mar 03 2017 09:45 PM,Our depth sounder displays water depth but does not record any data... a system to record the data for upload would be needed.,
37,Feb 09 2017 12:45 PM,I am concerned that the app will run in the background on my phone while I am at sea and use a lot of battery power. Navionics already provides good local data for me that is updated by users so I am not sure what else I would gain from this App other than being able to contribute to needed seafloor mapping data.,
